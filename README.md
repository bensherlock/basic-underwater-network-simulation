# Basic Underwater Acoustic Network Simulation

A basic underwater acoustic network simulation framework with example scenario of two sensor nodes periodically sending data to a gateway node, the gateway node replying with acknowledgements, and the sensor node retrying if it doesnt received the acknoweledgement. 

Acoustic propagation is greatly simplified to use straightline ranges for propagation delay and transmission losses. Probability of packet delivery is based on simulations of a modem waveform and receiver structure found in [Ultra-Low-Cost and Ultra-Low-Power, Miniature Acoustic Modems Using Multipath Tolerant Spread-Spectrum Techniques](https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics11091446).
